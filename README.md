# Cryptography is fun
In this repository I will be implementing some basic Cryptographic algorithms using Python.
The community can feel free to contribute or learn as well.

## Going back 2000 years
### Caesar Cipher
This is a 2000 years old Cipher where the key is added to the Alphabets and the final encrypted string is created.
The formulae of encryption is : (x+k) % 26
The caesar_cipher.py implements encryption & decryption of the same.
